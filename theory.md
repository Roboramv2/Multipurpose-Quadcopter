## Theory:

1. Angular Momentum:
   * The momentum caused by the motors should be cancelled out by each other, otherwise the drone will spin out of control. The propellers and the prop nuts are of CW and CCW design/threading.
   * Diagonally opposite motors are made to spin in same direction. Front left and back right motors have CCW prop nuts and themselves rotate in CW direction. The other pair has CW prop nuts and rotate in CCW direction.

2. Material strength:
   * Material used for frame design is foamboard (styrofoam+polystyrene). It is stronger than cardboard but still weak enough to bend under the weight of the LiPo battery.
   * To counter this, a double layer of foamboard is used for the top frame and a box like structure is used for the housing of battery, arduino and connections.
