## Theory:

1. Angular Momentum:
    * The momentum caused by the motors should be cancelled out by each other, otherwise the drone will spin out of control. The propellers and the prop nuts are of CW and CCW design/threading.
    * Diagonally opposite motors are made to spin in same direction. Front left and back right motors have CCW prop nuts and themselves rotate in CW direction. The other pair has CW prop nuts and rotate in CCW direction.
